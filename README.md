# Abhinand's Pi Setup

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/featured.png" alt="Pi setup screenshot" width="800">
</p>

Personal `pi-setup` for [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev): extensions, custom themes, skills, config examples, and sync tooling.

**Recommendation:** install the Pi CLI first, then run this setup. This repo wraps and customizes an existing Pi install; it is not a replacement installer for Pi itself.

## Core model

`~/.pi/agent` is the live Pi setup. This repo is the versioned `pi-setup` copy used to back up that live setup to GitHub and recreate it on any machine.

```txt
Live Pi runtime / source of truth:
  ~/.pi/agent/extensions
  ~/.pi/agent/themes
  ~/.pi/agent/skills
  ~/.pi/agent/settings.json
  ~/.pi/agent/mcp.json

Versioned pi-setup repo:
  ~/dev/ai-agents/pi-setup
  updated from live Pi files by pi-setup-sync
```

Normal flow:

```txt
make Pi changes in ~/.pi/agent  ->  pi-setup-sync  ->  GitHub
GitHub clone on another machine ->  install Pi CLI -> ./install.sh --restore --copy-config -> ~/.pi/agent
```

Do **not** install this checkout as an active Pi package in normal use. Loading both `~/.pi/agent` and this repo causes duplicate skill/theme conflict warnings at startup. If you are editing Pi functionality while your shell is inside this repo, edit the live file under `~/.pi/agent/...` first, then run `pi-setup-sync` to copy it back here.

## What's included

| Area | Included |
| --- | --- |
| Launcher | Compact `pi` wrapper with one-line major/minor update notices |
| Install safety | `--dry-run` preview, `--backup`, and `--revert <backup-dir>` |
| Sync | `pi-setup-sync` copies live `~/.pi/agent` resources back to this repo, commits, and pushes |
| Extensions | welcome header, context breakdown, file-change review, safety guard, custom footer, local model manager |
| Config examples | Safe `settings.example.json`, `mcp.example.json`, `micme.example.json`, and `playwright-mcp.json`; the settings example pins OpenRouter through the local xray proxy |
| Voice dictation | Micme wired to the local [Handy](https://handy.computer) CLI — `alt+m` to dictate, no cloud STT, no API key |
| Browser automation | Playwright MCP server for interactive UAT on a private Xvfb display (no focus stealing), with a `browser-uat` skill and `uat.sh` environment CLI |

| Skills | Portable backups of installed Pi/agent skills |
| Smoke test | Docker restore/sync contract test in `tests/docker-e2e.sh` |

- `bin/pi` — compact Pi launcher wrapper
  - one-line major/minor update notices instead of large startup boxes
  - suppresses Pi's large built-in update boxes via `PI_OFFLINE=1` after its own compact notice
  - detects the real Pi binary from `PI_REAL_BIN`, `/usr/local/bin/pi`, `/usr/bin/pi`, or `/opt/homebrew/bin/pi`
  - preserves Pi's native themed header and loaded skills/extensions/themes listing
- `extensions/` — versioned copies of custom Pi extensions
  - themed startup welcome card with `/welcome updates on|off`
  - `/context` usage breakdown for startup tokens, messages, and tool calls (scrollback output; not added to model context)
  - `/filechanges` review/accept/decline workflow for Pi-made `edit`/`write` changes
  - `/safety` and `/permissions` guard rails for risky shell/file actions
  - custom footer with input/output/reasoning tokens, cost, context %, tokens/sec, model, thinking level, and git branch
  - `/local-models` manager for OpenAI-compatible local endpoints such as Ollama, LM Studio, RunPod, or llama.cpp servers
- `themes/` — versioned copies of custom themes
  - `nebula-pulse` *(current default)*
  - `opencode`
  - `tokyo-night`
  - `one-dark-pro`
  - `dracula`
  - `catppuccin-mocha`
  - `nord`
  - `gruvbox`
  - `rose-pine`
  - `synthwave-84`
- `skills/` — versioned portable copies of installed Pi skills
  - browser-uat (with `scripts/uat.sh` and the Xvfb MCP wrapper), codebase-design, diagnosing-bugs, domain-modeling, find-docs, find-skills, grill-me, grill-with-docs, grilling, handoff, hf-cli, improve-codebase-architecture, mcp-code-search, redmine-cli, safety-guard, teach, write-a-skill
  - ask-matt, code-review, implement, implement-spec, pr, prototype, research, retro, setup-matt-pocock-skills, tdd, to-questionnaire, to-spec, to-tickets, triage, wait-what, wayfinder, wizard, writing-for-agents
  - local additions, not in upstream `mattpocock/skills`: `skills/setup-matt-pocock-skills/issue-tracker-redmine.md` (a Redmine backend for the tracker skills) and its `## Local addition` section in that skill's `SKILL.md`
- `config/` — safe example config files
  - `vscode-keybindings.json` — VS Code integrated-terminal bindings that forward `ctrl+alt+d` / `ctrl+shift+d` to Pi as Kitty sequences (see [VS Code terminal keys](#vs-code-terminal-keys))
  - `micme.example.json` — Micme voice dictation wired to the local Handy CLI (see [Voice dictation](#voice-dictation-handy--micme))
  - `playwright-mcp.json` — base Playwright MCP config the Xvfb wrapper derives from (see [Browser automation](#browser-automation-playwright-mcp))
  - `models.example.json` — the OpenRouter vendor pin; `--copy-config` merges it into `models.json` instead of replacing it

## Set up from GitHub on a machine

Install Pi first (preferred), so `pi` already works before this repo adds the optional compact launcher. In containers or unusual installs, Pi may live at `/usr/local/bin/pi`; the launcher now detects that, and you can override it with `PI_REAL_BIN=/path/to/pi`.

On a minimal Ubuntu machine/container, install clone prerequisites first:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git ca-certificates
```

Fast path with preview first:

```bash
# Show exactly what would change without installing anything
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinand5/pi-setup/main/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --restore --copy-config --dry-run

# Install with a timestamped backup you can revert
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhinand5/pi-setup/main/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --restore --copy-config --backup
```

The one-line installer clones/updates this repo at `~/dev/ai-agents/pi-setup` by default, then runs the checked-out installer. Override with `PI_SETUP_CHECKOUT=/path/to/pi-setup` or `PI_SETUP_REPO_URL=https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`.

Manual clone path:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:abhinand5/pi-setup.git ~/dev/ai-agents/pi-setup
cd ~/dev/ai-agents/pi-setup
./install.sh --restore --copy-config --backup
```

For HTTPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhinand5/pi-setup.git ~/dev/ai-agents/pi-setup
cd ~/dev/ai-agents/pi-setup
./install.sh --restore --copy-config --backup
```

Useful installer options:

```bash
./install.sh --restore --copy-config --dry-run   # preview without changing files
./install.sh --restore --copy-config --backup    # save current live files first
./install.sh --revert ~/.pi/agent/backups/pi-setup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
```

`--restore` copies repo resources into `~/.pi/agent/extensions`, `~/.pi/agent/themes`, and `~/.pi/agent/skills`.

`--copy-config` copies `config/settings.example.json`, `config/mcp.example.json`, and `config/micme.example.json` into `~/.pi/agent/`, and merges `config/vscode-keybindings.json` into the VS Code user `keybindings.json` (existing entries and comments are preserved; a `.bak-<timestamp>` copy is written first).

`--backup` saves current `extensions`, `themes`, `skills`, `settings.json`, and `mcp.json` under `~/.pi/agent/backups/pi-setup-*` before replacing anything. Revert with the exact command printed at the end of install.

The example settings pin the startup model with `defaultProvider` + `defaultModel` (both are required — `defaultModel` is the bare model id, not `provider/model`). If that provider is not configured on your machine, Pi falls back to the first authenticated model. `enabledModels` is intentionally **not** included: those patterns are machine-specific and can produce noisy "No models match pattern" warnings for anyone restoring this repo before configuring their own providers.

Provider routing in the example:

- `defaultProvider` is `openrouter` with `defaultModel` `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017`; the key comes from `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- `httpProxy` is `http://127.0.0.1:10808` — the local xray inbound. Pi applies it as `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` for its own HTTP clients (only when those env vars are unset), so OpenRouter works even when the shell has no proxy env. Change or drop it on machines without that proxy. Keep `NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1` in the shell so local endpoints (LM Studio, local MCP) bypass the proxy.
- `subagents.agentOverrides` and `observational-memory.models` point at the same OpenRouter model (`scout`/`researcher` low thinking, `worker`/`consolidator` medium).
- The vendor pin (`deepinfra → inference-net → morph`) lives in `~/.pi/agent/models.json` as `providers.openrouter.modelOverrides`, not in `settings.json`. `config/models.example.json` carries it for restores: `--copy-config` deep-merges that file into the live `models.json`, so other providers (RouterAI, custom endpoints) survive. Order is by observed cost, not list price: OpenRouter's own per-endpoint cache hit rate decides it, because a uniform 94% cache-read assumption flatters providers that cache worse. Read the rates from the frontend stats API the model page uses:

```bash
curl -s "https://openrouter.ai/api/frontend/v1/stats/effective-pricing?permaslug=deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-20261017&shape=v7&variant=standard"
```

It returns `providerSummaries[].cacheHitRate` and `effectiveInputPrice`/`effectiveOutputPrice` per endpoint. At the 2,280.8M prompt / 11.72M output profile, with each endpoint's *own* measured cache hit rate: `deepinfra/fp8` $21.29 (95.6%), `morph/fp8` $18.98 (87.3%), `inference-net/fp8` $42.17 (89.7%). `deepinfra/fp8/flex` is cheaper still ($12.43, 97.5%) but sits outside Standard routing with p50 3.6 s. List prices only: `curl -s https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models/deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017/endpoints`.

Check `status` on that `api/v1` response before trusting the order: `morph/fp8` went `0 → -2 → -5` with 23% uptime over 30 minutes on 2026-11-11. `allow_fallbacks: true` covers the failure, at the cost of a retry on every request — which is why `morph` sits **last** despite being the cheapest: it is the cheapest only while it is serving. `deepinfra` leads on both health and cache hit rate, `inference-net` is the neutral fallback, and `morph` is promoted again once its `status` returns to 0.

- The previous RouterAI provider block and settings are archived in `~/p/tunnels/docs/client/ai-routing/routerai-provider-config-backup-2026-11-11.md`.
- `config/models.example.json` also carries the four RouterAI pins (`z-ai/glm-5.3`, `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017`, `~deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-latest`) under `providers.routerai.modelOverrides`. They are inert unless a `routerai` provider with `ROUTERAI_API_KEY` exists, and the merge leaves that provider's 36-model catalog alone. RouterAI honours the same `provider.only`/`order` contract — an unknown slug returns `No endpoints found matching your provider preferences` — and its `/api/v1/models/<id>/endpoints` returns per-endpoint `tag`, `quantization`, `status`, and prices in **RUB**, so order by price within RouterAI, never across the two providers. Only those four models are pinned; the other 32 route freely. **Where a model is pinned on both providers, RouterAI copies the OpenRouter order** — `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017` is `deepinfra → inference-net → morph` on both, so the two providers never disagree about which vendor is preferred. RouterAI exposes no cache-hit or uptime stats (its `/api/frontend/*` is 404), so for models OpenRouter has no rule for, the order falls back to listed price with `status != 0` demoted.

Warnings:

- `--restore` replaces the current contents of those live resource directories.
- `--copy-config` overwrites `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` and `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`, and merges (does not overwrite) `~/.pi/agent/models.json`.
- `--copy-config` only *adds* missing VS Code keybindings; it never rewrites or removes existing ones. Set `VSCODE_KEYBINDINGS=/path/to/keybindings.json` to target a non-default location (e.g. VS Code Insiders or a profile).
- Use `--dry-run` first if you only want to preview the restore.

## Use your own GitHub repo

`pi-setup-sync` does not hardcode a GitHub URL. It commits in the checkout it is installed from and runs `git push`, so it uses that checkout's configured git remote.

For your own backup, fork or create your own repo first, then clone that repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git ~/dev/ai-agents/pi-setup
cd ~/dev/ai-agents/pi-setup
./install.sh --restore --copy-config
```

If you cloned this repo first and want future syncs to push to your own GitHub repo, change `origin`:

```bash
git remote -v
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<user>/<repo>.git
git remote -v
```

Then `pi-setup-sync` will back up your live `~/.pi/agent` changes to that remote.

## Install helper commands only

On a machine that already has the live files in `~/.pi/agent`, run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This installs:

- `pi-setup-sync` into `~/.local/bin`
- compact launcher `bin/pi` into `~/.local/bin/pi`

It also removes any legacy settings entry that points Pi at this repo as an active package.

## Uninstall pi-setup changes

To remove only what this repo installed/restored while leaving the underlying Pi CLI untouched:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This removes the compact launcher, the `pi-setup-sync` helper if it points at this checkout, and restored resources under `~/.pi/agent/extensions`, `themes`, and `skills` that are owned by this repo. It removes copied example config files only when they are still identical to the examples; modified settings are left in place.

Preview first:

```bash
./uninstall.sh --dry-run
```

## Sync live Pi tweaks back to GitHub

After changing Pi locally, run this from the repo:

```bash
./sync.sh
```

Install the global helper from this checkout:

```bash
./setup_sync.sh
```

Then use it from anywhere:

```bash
pi-setup-sync
```

`pi-setup-sync` copies current `~/.pi/agent/extensions`, `~/.pi/agent/themes`, selected skills, `settings.json`, `mcp.json`, and `micme.json` into this repo, validates JSON/theme tokens, commits, and pushes. It strips any self-referential package entry that would make Pi load this `pi-setup` repo at startup.

Syncing requires `git` and `python3`; pushing requires normal GitHub credentials for this repo.

Custom commit message:

```bash
pi-setup-sync "Update themes and footer"
```

Commit without pushing:

```bash
pi-setup-sync --no-push "Checkpoint local Pi setup"
```

Skill backup scans `~/.pi/agent/skills` and `~/.agents/skills`, resolves symlinks, dedupes duplicates, and stores portable copies in `skills/`. All skills are selected by default; press Enter at the selector to accept all in one keystroke. To customize, use ↑/↓ to move, Space to toggle, `a` for all, `n` for none, and Enter to continue.

Non-interactive options:

```bash
pi-setup-sync --all-skills
pi-setup-sync --skills hf-cli,diagnosing-bugs "Back up selected skills"
pi-setup-sync --no-skills "Skip skill backup"
```

## Manual tests

Run the Docker end-to-end smoke test when you want to verify the setup/restore contract without adding CI:

```bash
tests/docker-e2e.sh
```

The test starts a fresh Ubuntu container, installs minimal clone prerequisites, clones this repo from its git remote, runs `./install.sh --restore --copy-config`, verifies the live `~/.pi/agent` layout, then checks that `pi-setup-sync` can copy a live change back into the cloned repo without pushing.

Useful variants:

```bash
tests/docker-e2e.sh --restore-only
tests/docker-e2e.sh --remote https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git --branch main
```

## Feature audit

This repo currently includes these Pi customizations.

### Launcher and startup

- `bin/pi` wraps an existing Pi CLI instead of replacing it.
- Shows compact update notices only for major/minor Pi or npm package updates.
- Uses `PI_COMPACT_UPDATE_CHECK=0` or `/welcome updates off` to disable compact update notices.
- Uses `PI_REAL_BIN=/path/to/pi` if Pi is installed somewhere unusual.
- `extensions/flow-title.ts` replaces the startup header with a themed Pi logo, version, active model, cwd, key hints, and project name.

### Transcript rendering

- `extensions/collapse-bash.ts` overrides the built-in `bash` renderers so each shell call takes one line: `$ npm test ✓ 0.8s` (or `✗` on failure). `Ctrl+O` still expands the full output.

### Commands added by extensions

```txt
/welcome updates on|off       # toggle compact startup update notices
/context                      # explain context-window usage
/filechanges                  # inspect tracked edit/write changes and diffs
/filechanges-accept [force]   # keep files and clear the filechanges log
/filechanges-decline [force]  # revert tracked Pi-made changes
/safety enable|disable|status # manage Safety Guard
/permissions ...              # alias for /safety
/local-models                 # add, refresh, remove, and select local LLM endpoints
```

### Context and review workflow

- `/context` estimates startup prompt, skills, context files, selected tools, messages, and tool-call result usage.
- `/filechanges` tracks successful Pi `edit` and `write` tool calls, stores baselines in the session, shows a status/widget, renders diffs, and can accept or revert all tracked changes.
- Non-interactive accept/decline requires `force` to avoid accidental destructive reverts.

### Safety Guard

- Injects a short safety instruction before agent start.
- Blocks or asks for confirmation before destructive/risky actions not explicitly requested by the user.
- Detects force pushes, amend/rebase/reset hard, branch/tag deletion, recursive deletion, protected path writes, package removals, service changes, broad `sudo`, and context purge.
- In git repos, normal recoverable edits are allowed without extra prompts.

### Local models

- `/local-models` manages OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- Stores endpoint metadata in `~/.pi/agent/local-models.json`.
- Registers available models as `local-<endpoint-id>` providers during extension load so `/model` can see them.
- Supports endpoint refresh, model selection, and endpoint removal.

### Footer and themes

- Custom footer shows input/output/reasoning tokens, cost, context percentage, tokens/sec, current model, thinking level, and git branch.
- Theme files define reusable palettes for the header, footer, diffs, thinking levels, markdown, and tool output.

### Configured packages

`config/settings.example.json` registers these external Pi packages by default:

- ask-user-question and todo tools
- Markdown preview/export
- MCP adapter
- context-mode and related context skills
- goal completion helper
- advisor tool
- spinner, `/btw`, and fff search

`config/mcp.example.json` configures two MCP servers: the remote grep server and the
Playwright browser server. See [Browser automation](#browser-automation-playwright-mcp).

### Rewind checkpoints (removed)

`@ayulab/pi-rewind` was dropped from the package list on 2026-11-11. It auto-checkpointed the
session cwd with `git add` into one bare repo per session under
`~/.pi/agent/ayu/checkpoints/sessions`, with no blob sharing between sessions: 25 GB after
~100 sessions, ~745 MB for a single session in a large project. Launched from `$HOME` it walked
the entire home tree, so Pi printed nothing and appeared to hang at startup; the workaround was
`~/.pi/settings.json` with `{ "ayu": { "checkpoint": { "enabled": false } } }`.

The package and `~/.pi/agent/ayu` are both gone. `/rewind` and `/tree` file restore are no longer
available; if the package comes back, set `ayu.checkpoint.exclude` (or `enabled: false`) before
the first session in any large project.

### pstack skills (not installed)

pstack is Cursor's engineering-workflow skill set (`architect`, `arena`, `interrogate`,
`thermos`, `deslop`, `poteto-mode`, `principle-*`). It is **not** installed here: the
`pstack-claude-mirror` package registered a tool named `ask_user_question`, which collides with
`@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question` and stops Pi from starting. It was removed on 2026-11-11.

Which ports are safe next to this setup's tools, which ones collide, and how to re-check the
numbers before installing anything: [docs/pstack-on-pi.md](docs/pstack-on-pi.md).

## Voice dictation (Handy + Micme)

`alt+m` toggles dictation inside Pi. Audio is recorded with `ffmpeg`, transcribed by the local [Handy](https://handy.computer) CLI, and appended to the focused editor for review — no cloud STT, no API key.

```bash
pi install npm:@senad-d/micme
```

`config/micme.example.json` is restored to `~/.pi/agent/micme.json` by `./install.sh --copy-config`. It sets:

| Key | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MICME_TRANSCRIBE_BACKEND` | `custom` | Use the shell command instead of whisper.cpp |
| `MICME_TRANSCRIBE_COMMAND` | `handy --transcribe-file {audio} --json > {tempDir}/handy.json && jq -r .text {tempDir}/handy.json` | Handy's headless CLI; the `> file && jq` form surfaces Handy failures instead of returning an empty transcript (`sh -lc` is dash, so `pipefail` is unavailable) |
| `MICME_RECORD_SAMPLE_RATE` | `16000` | Handy rejects anything but 16 kHz mono 16-bit PCM |
| `MICME_SHORTCUT` | `alt+m` | Same binding as upstream pi-dictate |
| `MICME_AUTO_SUBMIT` | `0` | Paste for review, never auto-send |

Handy must have a model installed (`handy --list-models` marks installed ones with `✓`). Each dictation cold-loads the model (~1-2 s) because `--transcribe-file` runs a separate process from the running app.

Verify the wiring without touching the mic:

```bash
cd /tmp && git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/senad-d/micme && cd micme \
  && npm install --ignore-scripts --legacy-peer-deps \
  && node --experimental-strip-types scripts/doctor.mjs
```

Expect `✓ effective backend: custom` and `✓ custom transcribe command: configured`. The doctor must run from a checkout, not from `node_modules` — Node refuses type-stripping there.

## Browser automation (Playwright MCP)

Interactive browser UAT: navigating, clicking, filling forms, reading console and
network activity, and taking screenshots of a real browser. This is for manual
testing and debugging, not for authoring CI test suites.

The browser runs on a **private Xvfb display**, so it never opens a window on
your desktop, never steals focus, and never covers your editor. Screenshots are
the only way to see it.

### What is configured

`config/mcp.example.json` registers the server through a wrapper script:

```json
"playwright": {
  "command": "~/.pi/agent/skills/browser-uat/scripts/playwright-mcp-xvfb.sh",
  "args": ["--isolated"]
}
```

The wrapper (`skills/browser-uat/scripts/playwright-mcp-xvfb.sh`) owns the
launch details so `mcp.json` stays readable:

- starts `Xvfb`, which picks its own free display number (via `-displayfd`), at `1920x1080x24`
- derives an Xvfb config from `~/.pi/agent/playwright-mcp.json`, swapping
  `--start-maximized` (a no-op without a window manager) for `--window-size`
- writes screenshots, snapshots, and console logs to `$TMPDIR/browser-uat`
  instead of `./.playwright-mcp/` in the repo
- closes an idle browser after 15 minutes
- kills the display when the MCP server exits
- falls back to `--headless` when Xvfb is missing, so UAT still works

Override the wrapper defaults with `UAT_HEADLESS`, `UAT_SCREEN`, `UAT_ARTIFACTS`,
`UAT_IDLE_TIMEOUT`, `UAT_MCP_PKG`, or `UAT_PLAYWRIGHT_CONFIG`; the wrapper header
documents each.

The `:99`-`:120` display scan belongs to `uat.sh display start`, which is only for
manual debugging; the wrapper never scans.

`config/playwright-mcp.json` is the base config the wrapper derives from:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "launchOptions": { "args": ["--start-maximized", "--ozone-platform=x11"] },
    "contextOptions": { "viewport": null }
  }
}
```

- The server version is pinned in the wrapper (`UAT_MCP_PKG`) so the tool surface
  is reproducible. Bump it deliberately.
- `--isolated` keeps the browser profile in memory and never touches your real
  browser profile. Logins therefore do not persist between restarts.
- `viewport: null` is required for the window size to mean anything; otherwise
  Playwright pins a fixed viewport inside a default-sized window.
- `--ozone-platform=x11` is kept in the base config; it is harmless on the Xvfb
  path (`DISPLAY` is set, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is unset) and required on the
  headless/fallback path, where `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` may still be set.

### Verify the setup

```bash
~/.pi/agent/skills/browser-uat/scripts/uat.sh doctor
```

`doctor` checks npx, a browser, Xvfb, the MCP entry, and the artifact directory,
and prints the exact fix for anything missing. `install.sh` runs a subset of
these checks in advisory mode and never installs prerequisites for you.

Inside Pi, a newly added server is only callable after `/reload` (or a new
session). The first `npx` run downloads the server package, so the first
connection is slow.

### Managing the environment

```bash
uat.sh doctor                     # preconditions, with fixes
uat.sh config install [--dry-run] # point ~/.pi/agent/mcp.json at the wrapper
uat.sh config show                # effective playwright config
uat.sh display start|stop|status  # standalone Xvfb for manual debugging
uat.sh artifacts list|clean|path  # screenshots, snapshots, logs
uat.sh report                     # UAT report template
```

The browser itself is driven with `mcp__playwright__*` tools, not from the
script. The `browser-uat` skill carries the operating procedure: build a QA
inventory first, act from `browser_snapshot` refs, verify with console/network
evidence, and screenshot anything visual.

Two sharp edges are worth repeating:

- `browser_take_screenshot` **requires** a `scale` argument (`"css"` or
  `"device"`), even though the schema claims a default.
- Omit `filename` on screenshots so they land in the artifact directory; an
  explicit name resolves against the session cwd and litters the repo.

### Optional: pinned browser instead of system Chrome

The default uses your installed Chrome. For a fully reproducible browser:

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp install-browser chrome-for-testing   # ~150 MB, one time; version pinned in the wrapper
```

Then add `"--browser", "chromium"` to the `args` in `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`.
Trade-off: UAT then runs against a Playwright-managed Chromium build rather than
the browser you actually use.

## Useful Pi commands

Welcome update notices only appear for major/minor updates, not patches. Toggle them with:

```txt
/welcome updates on
/welcome updates off
```

Review files changed by Pi before keeping or reverting them:

```txt
/filechanges          # inspect tracked edit/write changes and diffs
/filechanges-accept   # keep files and clear the log
/filechanges-decline  # revert tracked changes
```

In non-interactive print/json mode, accept/decline require `force`.

## VS Code terminal keys

Pi's TUI reserves some modified keys before any extension sees them, and the VS Code
integrated terminal reserves some before Pi sees them. Two consequences worth knowing:

- **`ctrl+shift+d` is Pi's global debug dump.** `pi-tui` handles `shift+ctrl+d` in
  `handleTerminalInput` before the focused component, so it writes
  `~/.pi/agent/pi-debug.log` and no extension shortcut on that key can ever fire.
  The `filechanges` widget therefore collapses/expands on **`ctrl+alt+d`**.
- **VS Code owns modified keys in its terminal.** `ctrl+shift+d` is the default
  "Run and Debug" binding, so it never reaches the pty. `config/vscode-keybindings.json`
  forwards the keys Pi needs as Kitty sequences, scoped to `terminalFocus`:

  | Key | Sequence | Meaning |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `ctrl+alt+d` | `\u001b[100;7u` | `d` (100) with `ctrl+alt` (7) — toggles the filechanges widget |
  | `ctrl+shift+d` | `\u001b[100;6u` | `d` with `ctrl+shift` (6) — Pi's debug dump |

  `./install.sh --copy-config` merges these into the VS Code user `keybindings.json`
  without touching existing entries. Outside Pi, the same keys type the raw escape
  sequence into a plain shell — remove the bindings if that bothers you.

Verify what Pi actually receives with `/hotkeys` (registered shortcuts) and by pressing
the key: a working `ctrl+alt+d` toggles the `Δ N files (+x/-y)` line.

## Do not commit

Never commit secrets or runtime state:

- `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`
- `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`
- `~/.pi/agent/npm/`
- `~/.pi/agent/git/`
- `~/.pi/agent/local-models.json` unless intentionally sanitized
- cache files such as `mcp-cache.json`
